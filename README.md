## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Setting up a Custom Icon CDN

WEMS can dynamically load icon packs for the "Event Timeline" feature from an external CDN (e.g., a public GitHub repository configured with GitHub Pages). This allows for deep customization without modifying the application code.

To enable this, your asset host must follow a specific directory structure and include manifest files.

#### 1. Directory Structure
On your CDN or static file host, create a directory structure like this:
```
/images/icons/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master-manifest.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ minimalist/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon1.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon2.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ elegant/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ring.svg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cake.svg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
```
-   **`/images/icons/`**: The root directory for all icon packs.
-   **`master-manifest.json`**: The main catalog file that lists all available icon packs.
-   **`minimalist-pack/`, `elegant-pack/`**: Individual directories, each representing a single icon pack.
-   **`manifest.json`** (inside each pack directory): Lists all the icon filenames within that specific pack.

#### 2. Create the Manifest Files
You must create the two types of JSON files manually.

**A. The Master Manifest (`master-manifest.json`)**

This file acts as the main catalog. The application fetches it to know which icon packs are available to choose from in the admin panel.

*   **Location:** `/images/icons/master-manifest.json`
*   **Content:** A JSON array of objects. Each object has a `name` (for display in the dropdown) and a `folder` (the directory name).

**Example `master-manifest.json`:**
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Minimalist",
        "folder": "minimalist"
    },
    {
        "name": "Elegant",
        "folder": "elegant"
    }
]
```

**B. The Icon Pack Manifest (`manifest.json`)**

Inside *each* icon pack directory, you must create a `manifest.json` file. This file tells the application which image files belong to that pack.

*   **Location:** `/images/icons/[your-pack-name]/manifest.json`
*   **Content:** A JSON object with a single key, `icons`, which contains a simple array of the filenames of your icons.

**Example `manifest.json` for the `elegant-pack` directory:**
```json
{
    "icons": [
        "ring.svg",
        "cake.svg",
        "couple.png",
        "dinner.png",
        "envelope.svg",
        "glass.png",
        "heart.svg"
    ]
}
```

#### 3. Final Step: Configure the Base URL
After setting up your CDN with the correct structure and manifest files, ensure the `ASSETS_BASE_URL` variable in your `.env` file points to the root URL where your assets are hosted.

**Example in `.env`:**
```dotenv
ASSETS_BASE_URL=https://your-username.github.io/your-assets-repo/
```
The application will then be able to find your icons at paths like `https://your-username.github.io/your-assets-repo/images/icons/elegant-pack/ring.svg`.
